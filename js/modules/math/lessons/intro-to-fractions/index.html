            <p>A fraction represents a part of a whole. When you break something into equal parts, each part is a fraction!</p>
            <p>Think of a pizza cut into 8 equal slices. If you eat one slice, you've eaten <span class="text-blue">1/8</span> of the pizza.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The top number (1) is the <span class="text-red">Numerator</span>: It tells us how many parts we have.</li>
                <li>The bottom number (8) is the <span class="text-purple">Denominator</span>: It tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into.</li>

            <p>On a piece of paper, try to draw the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A circle cut into 4 equal parts. Color in 1 part. You've just shown 1/4!</li>
                <li>A rectangle cut into 2 equal parts. Color in 1 part. You've just shown 1/2!</li>
                <li>A square cut into 3 equal parts. Color in 2 parts. You've just shown 2/3!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Fractions are everywhere!</p>
