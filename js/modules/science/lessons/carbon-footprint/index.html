                    <p>Imagine you leave a footprint in the sand. Our actions also leave a mark on the Earth, but it's invisible! This is our <span class="text-blue">carbon footprint</span>.</p>
                    <p>It's the total amount of <span class="text-red">greenhouse gases</span> (like carbon dioxide) that are created by our everyday activities. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the Earth to get warmer, which is called <span class="text-red">global warming</span>.</p>
                    <p>The biggest parts of our footprint usually come from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Transportation:</b> How we get around (cars, buses).</li>
                        <li><b>Housing:</b> The electricity we use at home.</li>
                        <li><b>Food:</b> The energy it takes to grow and transport our food.</li>

                    <p>Let's think about our daily actions. For each question, think about what you and your family do. There are no right or wrong answers!</p>

                        <li>How do you get to school? (Walk, bike, bus, car)</li>
